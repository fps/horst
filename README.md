# lv2-horst

A simple header-only C++ library implementing an LV2 plugin host exposing plugins as jack clients. Python bindings are provided (these are actually the sole reason for the existance of `lv2-horst`).

# Requirements

Check the `nix-shell.sh` file. It should list up-to-date dependencies. It possibly contains some extra things which are not strictly necessary.

# Usage

Since packaging python-extensions is a horrible experience I chose not to do that. The python extension library is installed to `$PREFIX/lib/horst`. So add `$PREFIX/lib/horst` to your `PYTHONPATH`.

## The `lv2_horst` and `lv2_horsting` modules

# `lv2_horst`

`lv2_horst` is the low-level module implemented in C++

# `lv2_horsting`

`lv2_horsting` is a python module implementing convenience functionality. This is the module you usually want to import.

# Examples

You can find examples of using lv2-horst in the examples directory.

```python
import horsting as h
import time 

# The plugin's URI
uri = "http://calf.sourceforge.net/plugins/VintageDelay"

# Let's instantiate and run the plugin
p = h.lv2(uri)

# Let's get output port value updates
p.set_control_output_updates_enabled(True)

# Set some port values. Note how each port symbol has a "_"-suffix.
# This is done to avoid clashes with other identifiers.
p.feedback_.value = 0.9
p.amount_.value = 1
p.medium_.value = 2

# Connect it up to the system ports
h.connect(h.system, p, h.system)

# And repeatedly print out some output port values
while True:
    print(f'{p.meter_outL_.value:.5f} {p.meter_outR_.value:.5f}')
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

# Development scripts

The `dev/` folder contains some scripts that might be useful.

# Hacking

The file `src/horst_python.cc` contains the `pybind11` bindings for the library. It gets compiled to `horst.so`.
